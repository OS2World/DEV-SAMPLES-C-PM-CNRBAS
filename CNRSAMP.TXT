* CNRSAMP - Container sample programs
*
* This package contains the file - cnrsamp zipbin.  This file contains
* 2 other .zip files:  cnrbas.zip and cnradv.zip.  Both contain all
* the source files and makefile to build the corresponding executables.
*
* Unpack the cnrbas.zip and cnradv.zip files in different directories
* since both makefiles have the name - MAKEFILE.
*
* ex. d:\cnrbas>pkunzip2 cnrbas.zip
*     d:\cnradv>pkunzip2 cnradv.zip
*
* cnrbas.zip - This sample shows how to program a basic container
*              application.  It shows how to create a container window,
*              allocated record memory, insert records, and set up
*              and display all the container views.  It also shows
*              how to properly free all resources used by the
*              application when it is closed.
*
* cnradv.zip - This sample is based off of the cnrbas sample.  It takes
*              the cnrbas sample and adds additional function that is
*              common to many container applications.  The functions
*              added include:  direct editing, context menus,
*              processing CN_ENTER, providing IN_USE emphasis,
*              record sharing, sorting, and more.
*
* Updates will not be provided for the samples.  They are provided
* as is for developers writing container applications.
*
* Both samples are 32 bit programs are require OS/2 2.0 or above.  The
* samples will still be of use to anyone coding 16 bit container apps
* with the CCL/2 package.  However, context menus are not supported
* in OS/2 1.3.
